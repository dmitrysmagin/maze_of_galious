FAQ:

0.- I've downloaded MoG, but I cannot run it! What do I do?

Maybe you have not downloaded everything. To download MoG, follow these instructions:
- Download the DATA FILES (those are needed for any system: Windows, Mac, Linux or BeOS)
- Unzip the DATA FILES
- Download the BINARY FILES (the specific ones for your system)
- Unzip the BINARY FILES in the folder created after un zipping the DATA FILES
- You fill find the executable inside the MoG folder. Just double-click it (or write it's name
  in the command line) to play it.



1a.- Is there any other game better than Maze of Galious?

No, there isn't. So stop looking the web for other games and just play Maze of Galious.



1b.- Is there any other Remake of Maze of Galious?

Yes, there is a French one on the way, but at the moment of writing this lines, there is
only a demo version. And I still haven't been able to download it!



1c.- When will be the Remake finished?

At this moment(version 0.51), all the worlds are implemented, but lots of graphic work,
bugfixing and improvements need to be done, so not official date. 



1d.- Will the remake have the XXX feature?

If you want that MoG REMAKE have a feature XXX, just e-mail me. And if it's a good idea,
it will be implemented!



1e.- Are you going to make a Maze of Galious 2?

Yes, after finishing MoG remake, I'll start the Maze of Galious 2 project. There is still
no demo of it, but we have some ideas on the storyline. We are thinking in continuing the game
just after MoG finishes, and ignoring the story of "Knightmare 3: SHALOM". But, I'll give you
no more clues...



2a.- What to do to finish Maze of Galious?

The main goal of the game is to rescue PAMPERSE (the son of POPOLON and APHRODITE).
PAMPERSE has been kidnaped by GALIOUS. And you have to find GALIOUS and defeat him.



2b.- Well, I've to defeat Galious. But again:
     WHAT TO DO TO FINISH MAZE OF GALIOUS?

Maze of Galious is composed of 11 maps. The CASTLE and 10 WORLDS. You start at the CASTLE,
and to enter the WORLDS, you need the GREAT KEYs. The first one is in the room G13 (just
begin, go to the right room, and hit 3 times to the STONE).
Once you have a GREAT KEY, you have to find the WORLD DOOR (the first WORLD DOOR is in
room D13) and enter it.
In each one of the WORLDS there is a DEMON. You must kill the 10 DEMONs of the WORLDS to
finish the game. GALIOUS is the DEMON of the tenth WORLD.
Each time you defeat a DEMON, you will find the GREAT KEY to the next WORLD.



3.- Why some times when exitting the ITEMS screen, 
    I appear in the room of DEMETER'S Shrine (F10)?

When you have the Angel's Halo(found in room E13), and press ENTER in the ITEMS screen, you
are teleported to the room F10. To avoid this effect, you must exit from the ITEMS screen
pressing F1 again.



4.- How can I make the first world demon appear?

To make a world demon to appear, you must first know its name. To discover the name of a
world demon, you need the MAGNIFING GLASS (found at the ARES shop in room I16). The you
have to examine the TOMBSTONES of the world with the MAGNIFING GLASS. In one of them, you
will discover the demon's name. Once you have the name. You have to go to the demon's
room (the one that has a different music), and type the name of the demon.



5.- You allways talk about SHRINES but... what in the hell is a shrine?

In the game there are some doors, where you can enter by pressing the DOWN key. There are
just two types of doors: WORLD doors (they are closed, and you need a key to open them),
an SHRINE doors, they are allways open, and inside them, you can find SHOPS, HINTS, and
other things of interest.



5b.- Why I cannot enter certain shrines?

You need the SALT to enter some shrines.



6.- How can I use the special weapons?

POPOLON and APHRODITE are equiped with a SWORD from the begining of the game. But they can
collect new weapons (ARROWS, CERAMIC ARROWS, FIRE, ROLLING FIRE, MINES and the MAGNIFING
GLASS). To use this weapons, you must have the weapon OBJECT, then go to the ITEMS screen
and select it as your current weapon, and finally you must have some ARROWS (you can find
ARROWS by breaking STONES or by killing enemies), you can see how many ARROWS do you have
at the top of the screen (just above the COINS and KEYS).



7.- There are rooms where some bubbles appear in the screen, what is their meaning?

The bubbles mean that you are in a FAIRY's room. To make the fairy appear, you must keep
you character stopped in a special point of the screen for about 3 seconds, then a FAIRY
will appear and when you catch her, your lifemeter will be replenished.



8.- Is there any way to save/restore the game?

Yes, of course! Haven't you read the "PASSWOD DECODING SECTION" in my web page?!?!
To save the game, you must go to DEMETER's shrine (room F10), and note down the password
he gives to you (yes, yes, it's a 45 long password!).
To restore the game, you have to press L in the tittle screen, and retype the password
that you have previously noted down.
To avoid having to note down the passwords by hand, you can save a password to the hard disk
by pressing F5, F6, F7, F8 or F9 in DEMETER's room, and restore it by pressing the same keys in
the "password entering screen".
